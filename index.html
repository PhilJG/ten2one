                        Ten2One was founded to address the current state of community-police relations. 
                        The extreme distrust of law enforcement among African American and Latino communities has created a great need for open dialogue, civil discourse and methods to build trust. 
                        Ten2One was founded to address racially discriminatory police behavior and the use of excessive force in situations where police require greater integration with their racialized communities in order to serve and protect all.

            <div class="row">
                <img src="/img/sifu mack.jpg" class="henry-protrait"></img>
                <p class="about-text">Founder and president Henry Chapman has extensive experience as a teacher, martial artist, community activist, youth worker and security specialist. He grew up in the Ecorse projects in Detroit. As an African American living in an imperiled community, he was encouraged from an early age to study martial arts and learn skills to avoid violence. 
                    Through his mastery of martial arts, Henry devised and conducted programs such as WITS (Wise Intervention Training Systems), aimed at training bar personnel in preventing violence before it breaks out; self-defense and safety awareness courses like SAFE (Safety Awareness for Females Everywhere), MAGIK (Martial Arts for Guidance Inspiration and Knowledge); and Safe Passage, a self-defense and anti-abduction course for middle-school children that he runs in California. 
                    From 1984 to 1988, Henry served as a lance corporal in the United States Marine Corps. 
                    Throughout his career, he has worked with police authorities, faith-based organizations and non-profit groups dedicated to elevation of at-risk youth. He is an outstanding teacher with strong leadership qualities.

            <h3>Research</h3>
            <div class="row"> 
            <ul>
                <li>Analysis of data collected by the UK newspaper The Guardian (1) drew the conclusion that in 2015, “young Black men were nine times more likely than other Americans to be killed by police officers.”
                </li>
                <li>Defending the character of loved ones after the police have killed them can also be excruciating, adding trauma to an already traumatic situation. A study for the American Journal of Public Health in 2014 demonstrated the effects of aggressive policing on the mental health of young urban men. (2)
                </li>
                <li>There is no real data tracking the scale of police brutality on people of color in the United States. The National Violent Death Reporting System offers some data, but not all states participate. The absence of reliable data to track black deaths from police brutality makes it impossible to calculate the real damages caused by racist police officers and ineffective citizen oversight. 
                </li>
                <li>Past efforts for police reform have hit common barriers. In many major U.S cities, police union presidents have more power than the police chief.  Police unions block reform and undo officer disciplinary actions. 
                    The most glaring examples are cases in Oakland and Minneapolis. In 2009, police officer Hector Jimenez was terminated after he shot and killed two unarmed men. The police union successfully appealed, and Jimenez was reinstated with full back pay. In Minneapolis, the police union president Bob Kroll has explicitly stated that the four officers involved in George Floyd’s death were      denied due process. Additional barriers to reform include reluctant internal investigators and prosecutors
                </li>
                <li>A 2017 Pew Research Study found that the majority of police officers nationwide say their jobs have become more difficult and dangerous in the wake of high- profile deaths of black citizens during police encounters. <a href=" https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2017/01/11/behind-the-badge/">(3)</a>
